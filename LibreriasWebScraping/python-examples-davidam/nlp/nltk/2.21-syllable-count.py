    # - sum(): 3.33ish
    # - len(): 1.12ish.  the double-for listcomp LOOKS nicer, but single-for + strip is actually faster!

# final thoughts
# the ACTUAL amount of code I wrote was not that much!  only like 6 lines!
# but the correctness of those 6 lines depended heavily on learning various idiosyncracies about Python's string functions... batteries might be included, but what KIND of batteries??
# also, i noticed i'm REALLY bad at tinkering with listcomps... maybe with practice i'll get less inefficient, but...
    # agile mindset: write correct code as quickly as possible (semi-pythonic iterative, for me?), and refactor later...
