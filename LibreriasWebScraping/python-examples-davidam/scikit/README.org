* Naive Bayes Classification
+ To mark an email as spam or not spam
+ Classify a news article about technology, politics, or sports
+ Check a piece of text expressing positive emotions, or negative emotions?
+ Used for face recognition software.

* Logistic Regression
In general, regressions can be used in real-world applications such as:

+ Credit Scoring
+ Measuring the success rates of marketing campaigns
+ Predicting the revenues of a certain product
+ Is there going to be an earthquake on a particular day?

* Support Vector Machine

+ Display advertising
+ Human splice site recognition
+ Image-based gender detection
+ Large-scale image classification

* Clustering Algorithms

Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects such that objects
in the same group (cluster) are more similar to each other than to
those in other groups.

* Principal Component Analysis

+ Compression
+ Simplifying data for easier learning
+ Visualization

* Singular Value Descomposition

In computer vision, the 1st face recognition algorithms used PCA and
SVD in order to represent faces as a linear combination of
“eigenfaces”, do dimensionality reduction, and then match faces to
identities via simple methods; although modern methods are much more
sophisticated, many still depend on similar techniques.

* Independent Component Analysis

+ Digital images
+ Document databases
+ Economic indicators 
+ Psychometric measurements
