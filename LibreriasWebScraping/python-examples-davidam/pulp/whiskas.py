#Next, before the prob variable or type of problem are defined, the key problem data is entered into dictionaries. This includes the list of Ingredients, followed by the cost of each Ingredient, and itâ€™s percentage of each of the four nutrients. These values are clearly laid out and could easily be changed by someone with little knowledge of programming. The ingredients are the reference keys, with the numbers as the data.

#The prob variable is created to contain the formulation, and the usual parameters are passed into LpProblem.

# Create the 'prob' variable to contain the problem data
prob = LpProblem("The Whiskas Problem", LpMinimize)

#A dictionary called ingredient_vars is created which contains the LP variables, with their defined lower bound of zero. The reference keys to the dictionary are the Ingredient names, and the data is Ingr_IngredientName. (e.g. MUTTON: Ingr_MUTTON)

# A dictionary called 'ingredient_vars' is created to contain the referenced Variables
ingredient_vars = LpVariable.dicts("Ingr",Ingredients,0)

#Since costs and ingredient_vars are now dictionaries with the reference keys as the Ingredient names, the data can be simply extracted with a list comprehension as shown. The lpSum() function will add the elements of the resulting list. Thus the objective function is simply entered and assigned a name:

# The objective function is added to 'prob' first
prob += lpSum([costs[i]*ingredient_vars[i] for i in Ingredients]), "Total Cost of Ingredients per can"

#Further list comprehensions are used to define the other 5 constraints, which are also each given names describing them.

# The five constraints are added to 'prob'
