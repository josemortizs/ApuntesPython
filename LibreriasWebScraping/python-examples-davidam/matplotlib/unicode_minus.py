Unicode minus
=============

You can use the proper typesetting Unicode minus (see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_sign#Plus_sign) or the ASCII hyphen
for minus, which some people prefer.  The matplotlibrc param
axes.unicode_minus controls the default behavior.

The default is to use the Unicode minus.
